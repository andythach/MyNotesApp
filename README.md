This project was created during my learning phase.

Recently found out about Node Js and how we can write JavaScript on the server side.

This project uses the MEAN stack to create a note taking web application, including:

1. Bootstrap

Some of the features includes;

1. user registration (removed). No longer needed because it's for individual use only.
2. user login/logout
3. user can:
i. create note, read note, edit note, delete note

The codes here are not clean, has not been tested.

The purpose of this repository is to host it on Heroku to examine how the application behave on "host" environment.

New developers are more than welcome to use the codes here in aid their learning phase.

Thanks.
