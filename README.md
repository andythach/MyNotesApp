This project was created during my learning phase.

Recently found out about Node Js and how we can write JavaScript on the server side.

This project uses the MEAN stack to create a note taking web application, including:

1. Bootstrap

Some of the features includes;

1. user registration (removed). No longer needed because it's for individual use only.
2. user login/logout
3. user can:
i. create note, read note, edit note, delete note

The codes here are not clean, has not been tested.
